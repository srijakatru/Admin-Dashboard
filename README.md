# Admin-Dashboard
 Admin Dashboard (RBAC) UI using React JS
This project is an Admin Dashboard built with React.js that implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). The dashboard allows administrators to manage users, roles, and permissions within the application. Each feature—User Management, Role Management, and Permission Management—is designed to enable easy administration of system entities, offering both a seamless user experience and robust control over access and rights.

The application structure is organized into the following key components:
1. **User Management:**
    - Provide a way to view and manage users.
    - Include options to add, edit, or delete users.
    - Enable assigning roles to users and managing their status (e.g., Active/Inactive).
2. **Role Management:**
    - Create a way to define and edit roles.
    - Allow roles to include permissions (e.g., Read, Write, Delete) or custom attributes.
3. **Dynamic Permissions:**
    - Design a method to assign or modify permissions for roles.
    - Display permissions clearly for ease of understanding and modification.
